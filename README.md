# Fast Framework system

If you want to create fast prototype of project, this framework is suitable for you. Fast start. Ease and famous tools and concepts help you create simple project. I don't think that this decision suite to production, use it only for prototyping.

###Start on localhost:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

###Start on windows:

```
npm install
npm run server
gulp #in another terminal's tab
```

###Start on server:

```
npm install
gulp build
npm run server
```

###Problems

If you will see error `Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::4422`, it is mean that port 4422 is busy, run command `ps`, see what pid runing on port and run `kill <PID>`;
